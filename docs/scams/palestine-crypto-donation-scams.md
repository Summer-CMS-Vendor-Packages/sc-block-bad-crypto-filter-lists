# Palestine crypto donation scams

Several accounts on social platforms including X, Telegram and Instagram are enticing people to make humanitarian donations to support the victims of the ongoing Middle East crisis.

However, these accounts, primarily listing crypto wallet addresses, have dubious origins, are not endorsed by an official charity and are very likely to be scams.

An example we came across was a "Gaza Relief Aid" account on X, which uses a website and maintains a presence on Telegram and Instagram:

<p align="center"><strong>Aid Gaza Twitter account</strong></p>

The domain, associated with the account was registered 2 weeks ago and is not endorsed by any established charitable organizations, contrary to its claim of being "An Islamic Relief Initiative" listed on the page's footer.

The website's copy, however, has been lifted from the [Islamic Relief's official website](https://islamic-relief.org/news/islamic-relief-calls-for-support-for-humanitarian-aid-in-gaza/).

It is also worth noting, other than a handful of "press releases" that are syndicated verbatim from news wire agencies reporting on the Israel-Hamas war and images of injured war victims, the website has no information with regards to the people behind it, the organization, or an associated contact number and a physical address.

The scam operators behind this account have listed their Ethereum, Bitcoin and USDT addresses on its website and social media accounts where funds should be sent.

Fortunately, the crypto addresses' transaction history and observed no donations have been sent yet to any of these addresses.

We further observed the Instagram account was no longer available, after likely being suspended.

Some social media posts showed a third party stating that they'd donated the funds and the person seeking donations _confirming_ having received them, but their wallet history indicated otherwise. This is very likely a tactic employed by suspicious accounts to lend more credibility to their operations. 

Suspicious accounts claiming to support Israel and Israeli victims are also making rounds. As an example, we came across a 'Donate for Israel' account on Twitter. The associated crypto wallet address once again shows zero transactions and sparse data associated with the Twitter account casts doubts on its authenticity.

One must note that none of the example accounts shown here are verified for authenticity and as such users should exercise caution when approaching such claims online.

## Fake fundraising emails impersonate charities

More than 500 scam emails, along with fraudulent websites designed to capitalize on people's willingness to aid those impacted.

These fraudulent emails and websites, crafted in English, claim to seek domains "for those affected on both sides".

The emotional language and visual aids used in these communications are once again a tactic to entice users to visit the scam, where they are prompted to contribute, only to lose their money.

The websites support easy money transfer options and accept a wide range of crypto: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether and Litecoin. An example is shown below.

Using the wallet addresses, experts discovered additional fraudulent web pages claiming to collect aid for various other groups in the conflict area.

In these emails, scammers try to create multiple text variations to evade spam filters. For instance, they use various call-to-donate phrases like `we call to your compassion and benevolence` or `we call to your empathy and generosity` and substitute words like `help` with synonyms such as `support`, `aid`, etc. Besides, they alter links and sender addresses.

Such scam pages can swiftly multiply simply by modifying their design and targeting specific groups of people.

## How to donate safely?

To avoid scams, scrutinize pages thoroughly before donating. Fake websites often lack essential information about charity organizers and recipients, legitimacy documentation, or lack transparency regarding fund usage.

In a succinct [blog post](https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2023/10/safely-donating-response-israel-gaza-crisis), Larissa Bungo, a Senior Attorney at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) shared several actionable tips that can prevent you from falling for scams. One of these tips includes researching the organization that is seeking donations:

> **Research the organization** especially if the donation request comes on social media. Search the name plus `complaint`, `review`, `rating`, or `scam`. And check out the charity with the [Better Business Bureau's (BBB) Wise Giving Alliance](https://consumer.ftc.gov/now-leaving?external_url=http%3A%2F%2Fgive.org%2F&back_url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.ftc.gov%2Fconsumer-alerts%2F2021%2F12%2Fhow-donate-wisely-after-disaster), [Charity Navigator](https://consumer.ftc.gov/now-leaving?external_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.charitynavigator.org%2F&back_url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.ftc.gov%2Fconsumer-alerts%2F2021%2F12%2Fhow-donate-wisely-after-disaster), [Charity Watch](https://consumer.ftc.gov/now-leaving?external_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charitywatch.org%2Fhome&back_url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.ftc.gov%2Fconsumer-alerts%2F2021%2F12%2Fhow-donate-wisely-after-disaster), or [Candid](https://consumer.ftc.gov/now-leaving?external_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcandid.org%2F&back_url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.ftc.gov%2Fconsumer-alerts%2F2022%2F09%2Fhurricane-fiona-make-your-donations-count). If the message was from a friend, ask them if they know the organization themselves. Find out exactly how much of every dollar you donate goes directly to the charity's beneficiaries."

The IRS has issued a similar [advisory](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-beware-of-fake-charities-check-before-donating) cautioning people to not "give in to pressure."

The UK government has published a guide on [how to donate safely](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/gaza-what-you-can-do-to-help), including a list of legitimate charities like the [UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine (UNRWA)](https://donate.unrwa.org/gaza/~my-donation), or the [British Red Cross](https://donate.redcross.org.uk/appeal/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territory-appeal). The legitimacy of these charitable organizations can be validated by visiting the government's [charity register](https://www.gov.uk/find-charity-information).
