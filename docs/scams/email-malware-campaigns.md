## Email Malware Campaigns

Three of the most common email malware campaigns being pushed around the internet at the moment:

1. **COVID-19** = The email says "you've been taken off the vaccination list and you need to click this link to re-register".
2. **Bank Late Fees** = The email pretends to come from a bank such as Wells Fargo and says "your account has late fees and you need to click this link to sort out your bank account".
3. **Missed Delivery** = The email pretends that you've missed a delivery and says "you need to click this link to sort out your missed delivery".

All scam emails contain a "call-to-action" to click the external link or open the attached file (which contains malware).

Once opened the malware installs on the device and hides. It then gathers information about the victim and sends it back to the hackers C2 system.
