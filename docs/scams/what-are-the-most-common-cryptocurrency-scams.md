## What are the most common cryptocurrency scams?


The number of financial scams for consumers to avoid was already nearly endless, but this figure exploded when digital currency - also called cryptocurrency - became mainstream. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), more than 46,000 people reported losing over $1 billion in crypto to various scams from January 2021 through June of 2022 and that figure only includes people who willingly shared this information with authorities.

The fact is, consumers tend to know very little when it comes to how digital currency works or how to keep their digital assets safe. And since cryptocurrency payments do not come with any legal protections or government assurances, crypto scams are especially attractive for thieves. Also note that there's no bank or other centralized authority to flag suspicious crypto transactions and that all crypto transfers are irreversible. With these details in mind, it's easy to see why the industry is ripe for fraud.

If you are interested in investing in crypto or you have digital assets already, you'll want to know how the most common types of crypto scams work, how to spot them and what you can do if you become a victim. Read on to get an overview of the most common crypto scams authorities are seeing right now, plus how to spot them early.

## Crypto scams to watch out for

Scammers are incredibly creative when it comes to luring you into a trap or getting you to share your personal information. For that reason, many crypto scams involve some type of impersonation, along with a selection of carefully crafted lies that are often tailored based on the victim they're targeting. The most common types of crypto scams perpetrated right now include the following:

### Advance fee fraud

A common example of fraud that's popular right now is offering a service or benefit for an upfront fee.

These can include services like lowering interest rates, canceling debt, restructuring student loans, or even more exaggerated claims like transferring overseas deposits or inheritances. But once you pay the fee, you'll never get what was promised. Worse, these scammers also try to collect your personal information for identity theft at the same time.

Advance fee scams can also include lotteries and sweepstakes - especially ones that alert you that you've won when you know you didn't even enter. Beware of collecting any prize if you don't remember entering to win. 

While there are legitimate taxes if you win sweepstakes, federal law prohibits spending money to win money.

Warning signs of advance fee scams:

* Any business or service that asks for a fee upfront before any service.
* A service that makes unrealistic promises especially around debt reduction or forgiveness.
* Asking you to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) before the work.

**How to stay safe**

* If you're asked for an upfront fee it may well be a scam. Check whether the service in question usually asks for money upfront.
* Keep an eye out for spelling mistakes or poor grammar in documents and on websites.
* Beware email address with Yahoo, Gmail and Hotmail - most legitimate companies do not use these.
* Make sure the email address matches the domain of the supposed organisation e.g. gov.uk or llyw.cymru
* Ignore texts or emails saying you need to pay a fee to get deliveries.
* Confirm organisations you're being contacted by are registered on [Companies House](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house)
* If you're concerned about a job scam you can report it to [SAFERjobs](https://www.safer-jobs.com/) using their online reporting tool

### Blackmail and extortion scams

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says some scammers will claim they have embarrassing personal information, including your own photos or videos, to lure you into a trap. They will typically threaten to make the information public, but with the promise of keeping your information private if you do what they want. Their demands always seem to be the same - you can make the problem disappear if you send them a crypto transfer right away.

You should [report blackmail and extortion scams to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us) immediately. Also, don't send the thief any money and don't communicate with them at all.

### "Business opportunity" scams

This scam can play out in a number of ways, but it typically takes place when someone contacts you with a business opportunity with the promise of helping you grow rich. In some cases, scammers get you to fork over your crypto by telling you they can provide you with exceptional returns, even doubling or tripling your crypto assets overnight.

Either way, you should know that there's no such thing as "guaranteed returns," and that's especially true when it comes to digital assets. If someone contacts you and says they can work wonders with your crypto and make you wealthy in a hurry, don't reply.

### Charity fraud

A charity scam is when a thief poses as a real charity or makes up the name of a charity that sounds real in order to get money from you.

These kinds of scams often increase during the holiday season as well as around natural disasters and emergencies, such as storms, wildfires, or earthquakes. Be careful when any charity calls to ask for donations, especially ones that suggest they're following up on a donation pledge you don't remember making.

**What to do:** Ask for detailed information about the charity, including address and phone number. Look up the charity through their website or a trusted third-party source to confirm that the charity is real.

### Cyber crime scams

E-crime is criminal activity carried out using computers or the internet. Find out how you can stay safe online.

You are 20 times more likely to be robbed at your computer screen than robbed in the street but people are still not doing enough to protect themselves from being a target on the internet.

Cyber scams occur when a criminal uses the internet to take advantage of victims. Most often, this involves the use of a realistic-looking business email or document intended to convince the victim to make a payment to the criminal. Other times, the criminal might trick the victim into providing confidential information or downloading malware onto their computer.

Be sure to carefully check the email address of any business seeking payment, because I've found that criminals often use email addresses that look similar to legitimate entities. If the email or document includes spelling, punctuation and grammatical errors, that is a sign it is a phishing email, in my experience. Do not click on links or open email attachments from unknown sources. One way to check the real link or email address is by hovering your mouse over the URL to see where it leads. Also be cautious of seemingly harmless social media quizzes that ask for a list of your favorite movies or otherwise mimic security questions. The answers provided could be used by scammers to access financial accounts.

#### Help improve your online security

Here are some very basic steps you can take to improve your online security:

* Regularly change passwords, especially on social media accounts.
* Regularly update antivirus software on computers and laptops.
* Teach your children about how to stay safe online.
* Never click on links or download documents received in uninvited emails.
* Always check online sellers before you pay for goods - only pay by secure means.
* Always be wary of anyone asking for personal information especially banking details.
* Advice about keeping your children safe online.
* Contact the Police to report online bullying, harassment or stalking.

### Dating scams

Using online dating websites, scammers communicate with you over a period of time. Once they're confident they've gained your trust, they'll tell you about a problem they have and ask you for financial help.

### Debt collection scams

Most debt collectors will contact you to collect on legitimate debts you owe. But there are scammers who pose as debt collectors to get you to pay for debts you don't owe or ones you've already paid.

**What to do:** Don't provide any personal financial information until you can verify the debt.

### Door to door scams

Door-to-door salespeople using high-pressure tactics to get you to buy a product or sign up for a service you don't want or need commonly involving aggressive pitches for charitable donations, investment opportunities, home services or maintenance on water heaters, furnaces, or air conditioners.

### Email fraud

Scam emails look like the real thing but watch out for links and attachments designed to steal your money or information.

#### Warning signs it might be a scam

Stop and think. There's a good chance it's a scam if the email:

* Contains a link or attachment that asks you to log on to an online service with your username and password or to provide other personal information.
* Requests a payment but the bank account and BSB details are new or have changed since the last payment you made.
* Claims to be from a well-known organisation or government agency but is sent from a free webmail address (for example `@gmail.com`, `@yahoo.com`).

Common scams via email include:

* asking you to confirm your banking details so they can give you a 'refund'.
* providing you with a phone number to call urgently.
* making a threat such as immediate arrest, deportation, or blackmail.
* threatening to stop a service or charge a fine if you don't act.
* stating you've been a victim of identity crime and offering compensation or help to recover money lost to scams.

### Emergency scams

The scammer pretends to be a family member or friend in trouble who needs money.

### Fake job listing scams

In other scenarios, thieves will create fake job listings or send unsolicited job offers in order to lure new victims to their scheme. The "jobs" they're hiring for are often in the crypto field, including things like crypto mining and recruiting other crypto investors.

Either way, these jobs all have one thing in common - you have to make a payment in crypto to get started. The scam can take on many forms from there. The scammer might convince you to make additional payments, or they'll make a deposit in your bank account and ask you to send them cash only for their original deposit to fail.

### Giveaway scams

This type of scam promises you free money or another type of prize if you fall in line with whatever they want you to do. Many scammers pose as celebrities or influencers in order to lure in new victims who don't know better and it can be hard to determine what's actually real.

As an example, crypto scammers constantly try to impersonate Elon Musk over social media and video in order to get people to send in digital assets. An Elon Musk "Freedom Giveaway" crypto scam that took place on Twitter even promised free crypto to the first 1,000 new followers who signed up, but the whole thing was a sham.

### Government Agent Scams

This scam occurs when the victim receives a call from someone posing as a government agent. The criminal creates a sense of urgency by demanding money or personal information immediately so that you can comply with the law.

Be suspicious of any calls claiming to be from a government agency asking for money or information because real government agencies will never do that. You can verify the identity of the caller by asking for their name and department and then hanging up and calling the government agency's official listed number to ask for that person. Never trust the caller ID because that information can be faked.

### Health and medical scams

The three most common types of health scams are miracle cures, weight-loss programs and fake online pharmacies.

### Identity theft

Identity theft is one of the most devastating, yet common types of fraud. 

Identity theft is when a fraudster uses your personal information to empty your bank account, take out loans, or even commit crimes. To do this, they need your most sensitive information. This includes your bank account numbers, birth date, and Social Security number (SSN). 

Be especially careful with who you give your SSN as it can be used for synthetic identity theft. Plus, it's not always possible to change your SSN, even after identity theft.

Warning signs of identity theft:

* Strange charges on your credit card or bank statements.
* Missing or unexpected mail (fraudsters use a change-of-address scam to reroute your mail to their address). 
* Calls from creditors for loans or debts you didn't take out. 
* Suspicious login attempts to your online accounts.

### Impersonation scams

The giveaway scam example we outlined above is also an impersonation scam, but there are many other impersonation scams to be aware of. For example, crypto thieves will say they're from the government or law enforcement in order to gain some credibility. From there, they'll convince you your accounts or assets are frozen as part of an investigation and that you can pay them in crypto to resolve the issue.

Other times, they'll say they're from a large company like Amazon, Microsoft, FedEx or even your bank in order to convince you of some other storyline. In the end though, the goal is getting your crypto no matter which lies they use.

#### Impersonation: Police/bank staff

This is when fraudsters pretend to be police or to work at your bank to convince you to part with your cash.

Often, these scams start with a text or phone call, and the fraudsters sometimes spoof the number so it looks like they are calling from a legitimate source.

Sometimes the scammers will even pretend to be from your bank's fraud team and tell you that you need to move the money to keep it safe.

Other people have been scammed in person by fraudsters claiming to be the police. Often these criminals pretend that they are investigating fraud to explain why are talking to you.

In total, $84.7million was lost to scammers posing as financial institutions or the police. On average, each victim lost more than $4,500.

#### Impersonation: Other

Scammers sometimes pretend to be from other trusted organisations including HMRC, delivery companies, broadband providers and even mobile networks.

They might claim you have an urgent unpaid tax bill, or even say they're giving you some money back off your phone bill.

**How to stay safe from impersonation scams**

* Ignore any texts or calls that say you urgently need to hand over personal information or move money
* Using a separate phone, or ten minutes after a call has disconnected - ring up the organisation in question, making sure you get the number from a trusted source - you can double check if a request is legitimate.
* Never give financial details over the phone.
* Check email address and websites carefully.
* Be wary of any texts, calls or emails that claim your money is at risk or that there has already been fraudulent activity.

### Investment scam

The FTC says that, in this scam, an "investment manager" you have never heard of reaches out to you with an incredible investment opportunity. Of course, the process starts with you sending crypto to their online account or downloading an app that will help you get rich and you need to do it in a hurry.

In many cases, these scammers will have legitimate-looking websites that use complicated investing jargon to seem real. If you log into your account with the platform, however, you may be blocked from withdrawing your money or only able to access your cash if you pay an exorbitant fee.

Investment and pension scams are some of the hardest to spot and the most lucrative for criminals.

Typically, investment scammers offer schemes that promise good returns and that need to be acted on quickly.

Often the fraudsters have fancy brochures and legitimate looking websites, so it's easy to get taken in.

Pensions scams are also rife, where criminals offer free pension reviews, early access to cash or promises of better returns.

Sometimes the investments will be unusual and there is a promise of an asset that you will own (like a parking space).

**How to stay safe**

* If a company is pressuring you to make an investment or saying that an opportunity is time limited, it's usually a scam. Legitimate companies will never pressure you to make a decision.
* Before making any financial decision speak to your friends and family. Consider speaking to an independent financial adviser as well.
* Check the [FCA register](https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/financial-services-register) to make sure that a company is regulated.
* Firms that offer guaranteed returns or early access to pensions are probably scams.
* If you get unsolicited advice or phone calls about investment opportunities, hang up the phone. Pensions cold calling is illegal.
* Report pension cold calls to the [Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)](https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/nuisance-calls-and-messages/).
* [Check the FCA Warning List](https://www.fca.org.uk/scamsmart/warning-list) to evaluate the risks of any potential pension or investment opportunity.

### Invoice and mandate scams

This is when criminals pose as a supplier and convince you to change the bank details that you normally pay to.

It's one of the most sophisticated types of scam, and the fraudsters do loads of research to see who your supplier is and when you usually pay.

Typically, the scammers will spoof a legitimate email address, so it looks like the person you normally deal with.

Often, you won't discover the fraud until your supplier gets in touch asking why you haven't paid your bills.

There were 2,166 cases in the first half of this year, and people lost over $19,000 on average.

**How to stay safe:**

* If you get a request to change payment details - look up the company contact details on their official website and ring up. The accounts department will be able to tell you if a request is legitimate.
* Be wary if you are getting more invoices than normal or if you're being sent duplicates.
* If you think you've been a victim of this kind of fraud, call your bank immediately, as you may be able to stop the payment.

### Job and employment scams

A scammer offers you a (non-existent) job, but you must first pay a fee or provide your banking or other personal information.

#### A Fake Job Offer Opened the Door to a Suspected North Korean Crypto Hack

In late July, a programmer at Estonia's CoinsPaid, a crypto payment provider, met over video link with a recruiter who had reached out on LinkedIn with a lucrative job offer. During the 40-minute job interview, the engineer was asked to download a file to take a technical test, which he did on his work computer.

A few days later, on July 22, the CoinsPaid security team noticed a series of unusual withdrawals - money was quickly being drained from company accounts. By the time they were able to shut everything down and kick out the hackers four-and-a-half hours later, CoinsPaid had lost $37 million, and both the origin of the stolen crypto and the addresses of the digital wallets that received it had been carefully obscured.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/blob/master/assets/images/north-korea-fake-job-posting.jpg" alt="fake crypto job listings"></p>

### Lotteries, sweepstakes and contests

Someone tries to convince you to send money or provide banking or other personal information to pay a fee or tax before you can claim a prize that doesn't exist.

### Pension scams

Since the pension freedoms were introduced in 2015, retirees are able to access large sums of money from pension pots.

An unfortunate side-effect has been that this group is now being targeted by scammers because they can potentially access large amounts of cash.

Pension scams will usually follow a similar path to investment scams, with contact normally being made by telephone.

#### How to spot it

Warning signs are similar to those for investment scams.

Unsolicited phone calls, or any unrequested contact, should be treated as suspicious. Anything involving high returns with low risk should ring alarm bells.

If you want to be sure a company is legitimate, [check the FCA register](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house), the [FCA warning list](https://www.fca.org.uk/scamsmart/warning-list) and the [Companies House website](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house).

#### What to do

[Report scams on the FCA website](https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/report-scam-us).

Or, if had money stolen through suspected investment fraud, [report it to Action Fraud online](http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/report_fraud) or [call them on 0300 123 2040](tel:03001232040).

### Pharming

Fraudsters create a fake version of a website where you go to and put in your login details and personal information without realising it.

### Phishing

Phishing is a form of social engineering and scam where attackers deceive people into revealing sensitive information or installing malware such as ransomware.

### Ponzi schemes

A Ponzi scheme is a kind of investment fraud that promises to help you make money. Often, it's tied to an investment in real estate or a new business venture. But your earnings aren't real - they're just new funds from new investors, which are needed to pay back the earlier investors. The whole scam blows up when the money runs dry.

Warning signs of investment fraud:

* You're promised high returns with little or no risk. 
* Returns dry up after an initial large payout. 
* You're pressured to invest or get others to sign up

### Phishing scams

A phishing scam takes place when someone pretends to be someone else, usually a company, in order to get you to willingly share private information. Many crypto phishing scams aim to get you to share your private crypto wallet keys, usually by sending an official-looking email that asks you to log in to your account.

### Pump and dump schemes

This scam takes place when a group of people get together to entice others into investing in a particular coin, usually by posting on social media to build up hype. From there, scammers work together to drive up the price of the asset until they all simultaneously cash out and leave all the new and excited investors holding the bag.

### Purchase scam

Purchasing scams have become increasingly common with the rise of online shopping.

This type of fraud involves tricking people into paying for products and services that typically don't exist.

Usually the photos are stolen from legitimate sellers to help convince you that a seller is legitimate.

Take Five to Spot Fraud says that common examples include: buyers paying deposits for pets that don't exist, DIY purchases and electronic devices such as games consoles.

* If a discount looks to good to be true - it probably is.
* Buy from legitimate companies you know to exist
* Check reviews on sellers and websites. Google them to see what other people have said.
* Check when the website was launched, if it's very new it might be suspect.
* If you're asked to pay by bank transfer instead of using secure payments be vary wary.
* Remember that entire websites can be fraudulent, it's not just ads on social media that are risky.

### Pyramid schemes

These scammers recruit people for fraudulent money-making ventures. Unfortunately, only those at the top of the pyramid become rich, while the rest earn little or nothing. Eventually the pyramid collapses, but the criminals that start it make their fortunes.

### Remote banking fraud

Online banking fraud is when criminals access your money digitally by getting hold of your personal information.

Sometimes, fraudster will use malware to hack your computer and get hold of your financial details.

In the first half of this year UK Finance reported 50,537 cases of remote banking fraud.

**How to stay safe**

* Make sure you don't use your banking password or pin for anything else
* Don't use public Wi-Fi for transactions
* Always log out of your bank account
* Protect your computer with a firewall and up-to-date antivirus software
* Let your phone provider know as soon as possible if you lose your phone
* Return your phone to factor settings before selling it or giving it away
* Don't install apps from unknown sources
* Never respond to texts about transactions. If you think a text might be legitimate, find the number of your bank (either on your card or on their website) and ring up and check
* Never give out banking details over the phone.
* Be wary of what you post on social media, sometimes scammers call trawl your profile for information.

### Romance scams

Finally, remember that romance scams are alive and well in the world of cryptocurrency. With this type of scam, someone pretends to become your love interest online, usually by weaving an intricate web of lies about themselves. These scammers can spend months getting you to build up romantic feelings for them, at which point they ask for crypto payments or lure you into investing crypto with them so you can spend your lives together.

At the end though, the romantic encounter was always fake and the person on the other end of the line wasn't who they said they were.

### Social media

After Georgina's husband passed away, she turned to Facebook to feel more connected to her family. Soon after joining, she received a friend request from a man named "Jim" - an attractive stranger who was serving in the military overseas.

The two hit it off, quickly building an online relationship. Jim had dreams of one day opening a gemstone business after his current service duty ended. But as that date drew closer, he started having serious legal troubles. He needed money to get home - and Georgina was more than happy to help.

When her family and the police finally found out what was going on, it was too late. There was no "Jim" - only a scammer to whom Georgina had sent more than $100,000.

Social media provides prime hunting grounds for scammers.

Last year, one out of every four fraud victims said the scam started with either a social media direct message (DM), ad, or post - with fraud losses hitting $770 million, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

If you or a loved one use social media, you need to be more vigilant than ever to avoid scams.

#### What Are Social Media Scams? How Do People Get Scammed on Social Media?

Social media scams are a type of fraud that is committed on social networking sites. Scammers often create fake profiles, befriend innocent people, and send spam messages or links that lead to malicious websites.

But that's only several of the ways that scammers can use social media to target you.

Other tactics include:

* Sending you malicious links that infect your devices with malware.
* Running online dating scams and coercing you into sending money or signing up for fake investment platforms. (The latest version of this scam, known as the **"pig butchering scam"** has cost victims over $10 _billion_.)
* Posting ads to fake stores that steal your personal information or money.
* Using **social engineering tactics** to trick you into giving scammers access to your social media accounts or sending them money and cryptocurrency.
* Using surveys and quizzes to gather sensitive information that they can use to steal your identity.
* Impersonating brands, celebrities, and people you know - and tricking you into giving them money or personal information.

Scammers can create an endless number of fake profiles and ads, putting billions of social media users at risk. So, how do you spot a scammer before it's too late?

#### Here's How To Quickly Identify a Scammer on Social Media

* **Their messages include a lot of grammar and spelling errors.** Many scammers aren't native English speakers and may use poor spelling, strange and unnatural language, or awkward formatting. Be especially cautious when someone's claimed background (where they were born, education, etc.) doesn't match up with how they write.
* **It's a brand new social media profile with little content or few friends**. The average Facebook user has around 200-250 friends. Regardless of the platform, Iif an account has fewer followers than that or is very new, it could be a scammer.
* **The profile belongs to someone with whom you thought you were already friends.** Scammers create "cloned" profiles to impersonate your friends and contacts.
* **You receive a random message with a link in it. Never click on links or engage with unsolicited direct messages (DMs).** This is how scammers trick you into going to **fake websites** or downloading malware onto your device.
* **You're asked to send money online (via gift cards, wire transfers, payment apps, etc.) or invest in cryptocurrency**. This is the #1 red flag that you're dealing with a social media scammer.
* **Posts or ads promoting a deal that seems too good to be true.** Low prices or hard-to-find items that are readily available are major warning signs of a scam.
* **You're sent to an online store that depicts signs of a scam.** Beware of sites that offer good deals but are missing basic information (like shipping times and costs, the company's address, and direct contact information). When in doubt, follow best practices on **how to shop online safely**.
* **The person insists on taking the conversation off social media and asks you to text them.** This allows them to bypass the security measures provided on most social media sites (or continue the scam if their account gets reported and banned).

### Subscription traps

"Free" trial offers of products and services that turn into subscriptions and monthly charges that are difficult to stop.

### Tax scams

Someone claiming to be from the IRS, HMRC etc tries to get your banking information about a refund coming or says you owe money and urgent action is needed.

### Unauthorised payment card fraud

This is the most common kind of scam, one common example of this is when lost or stolen cards are used to spend money. Sometimes criminals will clone a card, often by tampering with a cash machine.

Scammers may also sell details of your card number, card holder name, date of birth and address. This is also known as 'card-not-present' fraud.

Some scammers even apply for credit cards in another person's name so they can rack up bills.

The good news is, if you're a victim of this kind of unauthorised fraud, you should get your money back, thanks to the Consumer Credit Act 1974.

You need to report the fraud as soon as possible.

**How to stay safe**

* Check your bank accounts regularly so you can spot any unusual activity.
* Check your credit report monthly to make sure no one has taken out products in your name.
* Set up phone alerts from your bank that tell you when money is spent.
* If your card is declined, phone up the bank to find out why.
* Make sure you don't use your banking password or pin for anything else.
* Avoid cash machines that look like they've been tampered with.
* Don't let your card out of your sight including in restaurants and bars.
* Chop up any old cards.
* Don't use public Wi-Fi for transactions.
* Always log out of your bank account.
* Invest in a shredder to get rid of post and old bank statements.
* If you lose your card, cancel it immediately. Don't wait to see if it turns up.

## How to spot a crypto scam

When it comes to crypto scams, there are quite a few telltale signs that let you know you're about to be duped. Watch out for the following:

* **Anything that seems too good to be true**: If you encounter any crypto offer that seems so good it can't possibly be true, your instincts are likely spot on. Nobody is going to offer you free crypto for doing practically nothing and a little research can help you spot big claims that aren't backed up by any data.
* **"Pay to play" job postings**: You should never have to pay a fee to do a job or secure a position in the crypto industry. If someone makes you a job offer that requires upfront payment, you should run.
* **Promises of guaranteed returns**: Nobody can promise guaranteed investment returns and that's just as true in the crypto industry as it is with traditional financial investments.
* **Unexpected communications**: If you get an email, a phone call or a text from someone that wants you to log into a crypto account, send in crypto to resolve an issue or get involved in a business opportunity, you should promptly ignore it.

## How to avoid becoming a victim

While watching out for the crypto scam "red flags" we outline above can help you avoid trouble, there are other steps you can take to protect your digital assets. Consider the following moves to avoid becoming the victim of a crypto scheme:

### Protect your crypto with cold storage

You can keep your crypto in web-based, mobile or desktop wallets that are all considered "hot storage," but opting for cold storage instead can help you keep your assets safe. You can even keep your crypto in a hardware wallet that is actually a small device you can keep at home. This kind of wallet lets you keep the keys to your crypto in your possession at all times.

### Ignore unsolicited communications

If you get strange emails or phone calls from someone who seems eager to speak with you and quickly brings up cryptocurrency, the communication is almost certainly a scam. You should try to ignore messages from people you don't know and only reply if you can verify the person and situation is legitimate.

### Verify contact information

If you get phone calls or emails from your bank or another institution you actually use, don't reply to the email or phone number you were contacted from. After all, the initial contact could be fake. Instead of replying directly, look up the company's contact information on their official website and call or email them back there.

### Move slowly before you invest

There are legitimate ways to invest in crypto and other investments, but scammers always use high-pressure techniques to get you to invest before you have time to do any research. If you want to begin investing, spend some time learning more about companies you might want to work with.

## How to report crypto scams

Whether you believe you have spotted a crypto scam or you're already caught up in one, it's your duty to report it. The following contacts can help you put scammers behind bars where they belong:

* Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) at CFTC.gov/complaint.
* Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) at [https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us).
* Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.
* Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at ic3.gov/Home/FileComplaint.
* U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at sec.gov/tcr.

## Getting your money back from a crypto scam

The bad news about crypto scams is that it's virtually impossible to get your money back after you've fallen for a scammer's trap. The FTC says that, once you send cryptocurrency to another person, they have to willingly send it back to you or you can consider your digital assets lost forever.

That's why your best bet is spotting the signs of a crypto scam early so you can avoid it. If you wind up sending crypto to someone else, giving away your private keys or getting duped by a fake job offer that requires upfront payment, the lessons you learn may come at a huge financial cost.
