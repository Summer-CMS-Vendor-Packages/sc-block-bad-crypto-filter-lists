## Tech Support Scams

Tech support scams are a type of social engineering attack where fraudsters impersonate service or support representatives from well-known companies, such as Microsoft, Apple, or Best Buy, and try to trick victims into believing their devices are infected with viruses or malware. The scammers' goal is to extract money or sensitive information from the victim.

### How Tech Support Scams Work

1. **Initial Contact:** Scammers reach out via phone calls, emails, text messages, or browser pop-ups, claiming to be from a legitimate tech company.
2. **Fake Alerts:** They create a sense of urgency by claiming your device is compromised, infected with malware, or has a critical issue that needs immediate attention.
3. **Remote Access:** Scammers may ask you to download remote access software or give them control of your device to "fix" the problem.
4. **Payment Demands:** They may demand payment for their "services," often via non-reversible payment methods like gift cards, wire transfers, or apps like Zelle and Venmo.
5. **Sensitive Information:** Scammers may ask for sensitive data, such as passwords, 2FA codes, or financial information, to steal your identity or compromise your accounts.

### Red Flags

1. **Unsolicited Contact:** Legitimate tech companies won't initiate contact with you to report a problem.
2. **Pressure Tactics:** Scammers often use urgency and pressure to convince you to take action.
3. **Fake Phone Numbers:** Scammers may post fake phone numbers on websites or social media to trick you into calling.
4. **Remote Access Software:** Be cautious of requests to download remote access software like AnyDesk or TeamViewer, as these can give scammers access to your device and data.

### Protection Tips

1. **Verify Legitimacy:** Check the company's official website or contact them directly to confirm the legitimacy of the support request.
2. **Be Cautious of Unsolicited Contact:** Hang up or delete suspicious emails and texts.
3. **Don't Provide Sensitive Information:** Refuse to give out sensitive data, even if the scammer claims it's necessary to "fix" the problem.
4. **Use Strong Antivirus Software:** Keep your antivirus software up to date and run regular scans to detect and remove malware.
5. **Report Scams:** File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and your local authorities if you've been targeted by a tech support scam.

### Examples of Tech Support Scams

1. **Pop-up Windows:** Scammers may create fake pop-up windows claiming your device is infected with malware or viruses.
2. **Fake Support Phone Numbers:** Scammers may post fake phone numbers on websites or social media to trick you into calling.
3. **Emails and Texts:** Scammers may send emails or texts claiming your device or account is at risk and demanding immediate attention.

### Recent Cases
