## Scammers Impersonate Crypto Security Companies Pushing Crypto-stealing Websites

Multiple fake accounts impersonating cryptocurrency security companies and investigators, are promoting phishing pages to drain wallets in an ongoing campaign on Twitter.

To lure potential victims, the scammers pretend there has been a hack in the crypto space. The scenario urges users to act swiftly to safeguard their digital assets from potential theft.

The scammers impersonate accounts on Twitter belonging to blockchain analytics or crypto fraud investigation firms and researchers, like **CertiK**, **ZachXBT** and **Scam Sniffer**, to promote fabricated security breaches from Uniswap and Opensea.

To impersonate the legitimate accounts, the threat actors created new Twitter accounts with similar account names. For example, **ZachXBT** has the account `@zachxbt`, while the threat actors created and tweeted from `@zacheryxbt`.

Many legitimate Twitter users fall for the trick and share the scam on their accounts, some with hundreds of thousands of followers without double-checking the validity of the claims.

The scale of the campaign is also notable, with bot accounts promoting hashtags like `#UniswapExploit` to the point of them reaching top trending topics in the U.S. on Twitter.

**ZachXBT**, one of the accounts impersonated in this scam, first noticed this threat group utilizing this tactic was around November 9th 2023.

Hayden Adams - the developer of Uniswap's web application interface, warned the cryptocurrency community of the scam, clarifying that there was no Uniswap exploit leveraged in the wild and that tweets about this came from fake Twitter accounts impersonating well-known security companies in the cryptocurrency community.

## The scam explained

First the scammers impersonate accounts on Twitter belonging to blockchain analytics and security investigation firms or users, like `CertiK`, `ZachXBT` or `Scam Sniffer`, by creating similar named fake accounts.

They then tweet posts on fake crypto security breaches on `Uniswap` or `Opensea`.

**The tweets contain a phishing website link, with a "sense of urgency" telling the user to go to the website in order to protect their wallets!**

The scenario alleges that hackers exploited a signature verification vulnerability in the said protocols/exchanges to steal tokens.

**Users are advised to revoke the permissions as soon as possible** to prevent losing their assets by following a link to a malicious website!

Once the user clicks on the `Revoke Approvals` button and connect their wallet, **the scammers drains their funds**, which is a non-reversible process.
