## FTC warns of online task job scams hooking victims like gambling

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has reported a dramatic surge in "task scams," a type of online job fraud that lures victims with promises of easy money through repetitive tasks. These scams have seen an exponential increase, with reports skyrocketing from zero in 2020 to 20,000 in just the first half of 2024.

The financial impact of these scams has been severe. Job scam losses tripled between 2020 and 2023, with victims losing over $220 million in the first six months of 2024 alone. Task scams accounted for nearly 40% of all job scam reports in 2024, resulting in approximately $41 million in stolen funds during this period.

This alarming trend highlights the growing sophistication of online scammers and the need for increased vigilance among job seekers in the digital age.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warns that scammers initiate contact through unsolicited messages on platforms like WhatsApp, social media, or other communication channels. These fraudsters present an enticing opportunity to earn money easily by performing daily tasks, such as rating products or liking videos on online platforms or through specialized apps.

To appear legitimate, these scams often impersonate well-known companies like Deloitte, Amazon, McKinsey and Company, and Airbnb. Victims are typically assigned tasks in sets of forty items, with promises of increased commissions upon completion of each set and advancement to higher levels. This gamified structure is designed to keep victims engaged and encourage them to invest more time and money into the scheme.

Initially, these scams appear legitimate, with victims receiving small cryptocurrency payments of $50-$60 in USDT or Ethereum for completing tasks. However, the scheme takes a sinister turn when victims accumulate a substantial "commission" on the app. At this point, they're asked to make a deposit, ostensibly to unlock withdrawal options and access the next set of tasks.

Many victims, expecting to retrieve their deposit along with their earned commission, comply with this request. Unfortunately, this is when the scammers steal their money.

Numerous Reddit threads reveal victims' experiences, with some reporting losses as high as $8,500. One victim shared, "They paid commissions after I completed every 40 tasks... I actually got paid in crypto USDT at first, around 40 USDT each day. It seemed believable, despite my suspicions... Eventually, they asked me to deposit up to 12,800 USDT."

Another victim reported, "I lost $8500 CAD, and they're asking for another $6000 USDT. When I threatened to report them to the police, they told me to get a lawyer!"

To persuade hesitant victims, scammers often invite them to group chats featuring fabricated success stories from supposed workers. The gamified nature of these scams leads some victims to view them as a form of gambling, hoping their deposits will eventually yield larger returns.

The FTC warns that cryptocurrency use in these scams is a red flag, as it makes tracing the perpetrators more difficult. They also caution against buzzwords like "product boosting" and "app optimization."

The agency advises ignoring all unsolicited job invitations, especially those promoting simple online task-based work, as legitimate employers don't use such practices. Moreover, any job involving paid likes or ratings is illegal and should be avoided entirely.
