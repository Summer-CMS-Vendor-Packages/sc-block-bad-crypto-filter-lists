# 'Help Ukraine' crypto donation scams

Scammers are targeting unsuspecting users via phishing webpages, forum posts and email links enticing users to "help Ukraine" by donating cryptocurrency.

The development follows Ukraine's successful effort of raising over $37 million in crypto donations from all around the world amid the country's ongoing invasion by Russian troops. 

A series of cryptocurrency scams enticing users to "help Ukraine" by donating to counterfeit Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses that aren't affiliated with the Ukrainian government.

To facilitate this phishing campaign, attackers are using a variety of means, from phishing emails that appear to originate from `npr.org` or the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian (OCHA) domains, to posting forum posts claiming to be behind the "Help Ukraine" movement.

One such phishing email, is shown below:

Additionally, we came across a forum post shared on one of the forum threads that we have since taken down.

> The scammers posted a forum post says the following: "The attack on Ukraine brings a lot of trouble and death in our families! Fundraising to provide targeted assistance to those in need, regardless of their gender, age, citizenship," reads the forum post. Many people need food and clothes, someone is sleeping on the street!! Remember, every penny and every minute can save a life!"

Scammers also created fake `.org` domains to con prospective donors, see below:

A dubious donation site that could fool some on a first glance but contains broken links all over:

**What makes these scams particularly dangerous is their appeal to emotion** that unwary recipients may not be able to resist, especially at a moment of need for Ukraine.

The fact that the government of Ukraine is actively seeking crypto donations in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other forms of crypto from all over the world may inadvertently lend credibility to such scams.

## Ukraine raises over $37 million in crypto donations

In what can be described as the first-ever large-scale crypto crowdfunding effort from a national government, Ukraine has thus far raised over $37 million in Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tether (USDT) and other altcoins. Additional donations worth $13 million are expected to arrive as the country battles an ongoing crisis.

In a tweet posted by the official Twitter account of Ukraine, government officials shared the authentic Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses where funds could be sent to:

<p align="center"><strong>Official Twitter account by Ukraine government</strong></p>

This may have raised eyebrows among netizens suspecting if Ukraine's official Twitter account had been hacked and for good reason.

In 2020, attackers had hijacked verified Twitter accounts of prominent public figures and companies including Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Kanye West and Apple, to promote "double your cryptocurrency" scams:

In 2021, `bitcoin.org` was hacked with attackers having successfully stolen $17,000 from unwary users in a similar scam.

It's tempting to dismiss these scams thinking no one falls for them, but, similar crypto scams have been hugely successful and generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in the past.

However, subsequent tweets [[1](https://twitter.com/TomicahTD/status/1497601610775769094), [2](http://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1497549813205848068)] from Ukrainian First Vice Prime Minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, have confirmed the government's ask was legitimate.
