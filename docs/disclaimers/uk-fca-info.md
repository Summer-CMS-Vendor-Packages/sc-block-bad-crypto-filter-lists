## Notice to users and retail traders in the UK

**Due to the potential for losses, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) considers cryptocurrency investment to be high risk!**

### Steps to protect our followers

* The information contained herein is for informational purposes only. Nothing herein shall be construed to be financial, legal or tax advice.
* We don't do **direct message** (DM) to our followers in our social media accounts, if you receive a message claiming to be from us, it's a fake and most likely from a scammer!
* We don't do **giveaways promotions**, giving away **free non-fungible tokens (NFT's)** or **cryptocurrencies through airdrops** to promote investing in digital assets is prohibited by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) new rules!
* All adverts will be clearly displayed with `#AD` and the details of any sponsorship agreement with fees, commissions or other charges will be disclosed to the public (**currently we do not share any sponsored content**).
* We do not partake in **refer a friend** crypto bonuses (affiliate marketing schemes) which the FCA has banned under its new advertising rules.
* Users should be aware that we **own or hold trade positions of the cryptoassets shown in the shared trading charts!** Users should always **Do Your Own Research (DYOR)** before purchasing or copy trading.
* We don't trade, share or suggest any **scam projects, meme coins, low marketcap cryptocurrencies, NFT's** etc. to protect our followers from increased risk factors!
* Advoiding the use of **non-compliant crypto promotion memes images**. Memes seen as promoting crypto assets may need to add disclaimers in order to comply with advertising regulations. The FCA gives an example of a non-compliant crypto meme: "It consisted of a split picture, showing a person having difficulty spending money in the supermarket, compared with a person buying crypto with ease".
* There are plenty of scams in the crypto space and we have listed [what are the most common cryptocurrency scams](https://github.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/blob/master/docs/scams/what-are-the-most-common-cryptocurrency-scams.md) and suggest you get familiar with them in order to protect your assets.
* We have also created a crypto firewall block list in order to protect our followers from scammers, which can be found here: [Block Bad Crypto Filter Lists](https://github.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists)

> All cryptoasset financial promotion images (e.g. Trading Charts, Crypto Memes etc) on Twitter account(s) to carry the warning message:
> 
> "Don't invest unless you're prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong. Take 2 mins to learn more, see the Pinned Tweet."

WARNING: There are many impersonators of crypto projects, persons and companies. Please be aware of phishing sites and other online scams, and always make sure you are visiting our official [to be added] website.

**Purchasing cryptocurrencies poses considerable risk of loss. The use of any and all dapps, protocols and information at your own risk. The content shared does not guarantee any particular outcome. Past performance does not indicate future results.**

### What are the key risks?

**1\. You could lose all the money you invest**

* The performance of most cryptoassets can be highly volatile, with their value dropping as quickly as it can rise. You should be prepared to lose all the money you invest in cryptoassets.

* The cryptoasset market is largely unregulated. There is a risk of losing money or any cryptoassets you purchase due to risks such as cyber-attacks, financial crime and firm failure.

* It's also worth remembering that there are many competing blockchain companies looking for your investment (blockchain is the technology behind cryptoassets and cryptocurrencies) and that some will inevitably fail. 

**2\. You should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong**

* Theft: Cryptocurrencies can only be bought and sold on cryptocurrency exchanges. These exchanges are a tempting target for hackers and security breaches have led to the theft of digital currency, with not all investors getting their money back. DeFi (or "decentralized finance") is an umbrella term for financial services on public blockchains. DeFi projects are another tempting target for hackers and numerous hacks, exploits and smart contract vulnerabilities have resulted in users losing their funds.

* The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) doesn't protect this type of investment because it's not a 'specified investment' under the UK regulatory regime - in other words, this type of investment isn't recognised as the sort of investment that the FSCS can protect. Learn more by using the FSCS investment protection checker: https://www.fscs.org.uk/check/investment-protection-checker/

* Protection from the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) does not cover poor investment performance. If you have a complaint against an FCA regulated firm, FOS may be able to consider it. Learn more about FOS protection: https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumers

**3\. You may not be able to sell your investment when you want to**

* There is no guarantee that investments in cryptoassets can be easily sold at any given time. The ability to sell a cryptoasset depends on various factors, including the supply and demand in the market at that time.

* Operational failings such as technology outages, cyber-attacks and comingling of funds could cause unwanted delay and you may be unable to sell your cryptoassets at the time you want.

**4\. Cryptoasset investments can be complex**

* Investments in cryptoassets can be complex, making it difficult to understand the risks associated with the investment.

* You should do your own research before investing. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

**5\. Don't put all your eggs in one basket**

* Putting all your money into a single type of investment is risky. Spreading your money across different investments makes you less dependent on any one to do well.

* A good rule of thumb is not to invest more than 10% of your money in high-risk investments. Learn more: https://www.fca.org.uk/investsmart/5-questions-ask-you-invest
