## Block Spam Calls

The official Government website offers guidelines on how to identify potential scams. It urged people to look out for the following signs when receiving unsolicited contact:

- The message rushes you to act immediately.
- It is threatening in tone.
- It is unexpected or unsolicited.
- It asks for personal information, such as bank details.
- It asks you to transfer money.
- It asks you to buy or send a gift.
- It offers a refund, tax rebate, or grant unexpectedly.

### Scammers Impersonating Banks

The calling agents (scammers) used stolen databases, pre-written social engineering and scripts to trick the call recipients into giving away their sensitive banking information.

To make the calls appear legitimate, the calling agents (scammers) used caller spoofing technology, making their number and caller name match those of the official bank they impersonated, adding credibility to the process.

_The bait was an alert about unauthorized ATM withdrawals_, directing victims to go through a process of fake account verification and give away their one-time passcodes.

To protect against these scams, the police recommend only providing personal or banking details after verifying that you are speaking to an actual bank agent.

Also, it's important to remember that **banks never ask users to give away their card details, ID details, usernames, account passwords and one-time passwords.**
