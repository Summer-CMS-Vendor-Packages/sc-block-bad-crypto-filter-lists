<h1 align="center">Summer CMS Block Bad Crypto Filter Lists</h1>

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/blob/master/assets/images/cover.jpg" /></p>

This is a filter list to block browser-based crypto mining, cryptojacking, injected crypto malware websites and phishing websites (all trying to steal cryptocurrency from other users). Currently there are a few websites added into the lists. If you see other websites supporting these deeds, then feel free to raise an **Issue** or a **Pull request** to add them to the lists.

For a thorough explanation on how to add the to your adblocker, open one of the help guides found in this folder:

- https://github.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/tree/master/docs

There are two methods to install into your adblocker:

1. Click the link below:

- [https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/master/src/blacklists/nomalware.txt&title=Crypto%20Malware%20Block%20Lists](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/master/src/blacklists/nomalware.txt&title=Crypto%20Malware%20Block%20Lists)

- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/master/src/blacklists/nomalware.txt

## Hosts based blocking üí¢

For the blocking based on the [HOSTS file](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)>) use the below link:

### Hosts üíæ

You can simply copy and paste the contents of above file into your hosts file. The locations of your hosts file depends on your system:

- Linux: `/etc/hosts`
- MacOS: `/etc/hosts`
- Windows: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`

Whichever OS you use, you will require escalated privileges to edit the file (either use `sudo` for Linux/MacOS or administrative account on Windows). Or you can use command below for linux

```
sudo -- sh -c 'curl -sS https://github.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/blob/master/src/blacklists/hosts.txt >> /etc/hosts'
```

- ![pfSense](https://i.imgur.com/ElyO5Ie.png) [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/) with [pfBlockerNG](https://www.tecmint.com/install-configure-pfblockerng-dns-black-listing-in-pfsense/)
- ![Pi-hole](https://i.imgur.com/0mgKKma.png) [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net)

## Free DNS / Hosting blocking üÜì

This repo blocks specific free dns / hosting services, that are completely saturated with hosting malware and viruses. This is to reduce the size of the filter lists and increase the performance. A list of services currently blocked can be found in the folder here:

- https://github.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/blob/master/src/blacklists/free-dns-hosting/

## IP blocking üåê

IP Addresses can also be blocked, these contain things such as command-and-control (C2) servers for crypto malware etc. You can add them to a firewall of your choice.

The IP block list can be found here:

- https://github.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/blob/master/src/blacklists/ip.txt

For a thorough explanation on how to add block an ip address in your firewall, you can open one of the help guides found in this folder:

- https://github.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/tree/master/docs

### Custom IP Block Lists üìã

These custom IP address filter lists block specific malware and can be found in the folder:

- https://github.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/tree/master/src/blacklists/custom-ip-block-lists

> The reason why these custom lists aren't in the main IP filter list is because these IP addresses maybe shared and used for public access or hosting multiple domains! These custom IP address filter lists are for advanced users who can customize them in order to not block their access or applications.

## Email blocking üìß

Email addresses can be blocked, our email block list contains known Crypto scammers, Ransomware, Sextortion and Blackmail email addresses.

The Email block list can be found here:

- https://github.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/blob/master/src/blacklists/email.txt

To learn how to protect yourself from Sextortion emails, see here:

- https://github.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/blob/master/docs/scams/how-to-protect-yourself-from-sextortion-scams.md

How to Identify a Ransomware Email Attack, see here:

- https://github.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/blob/master/docs/scams/how-to-identify-a-ransomware-email-attack.md

## Fraudulent cryptocurrency wallet addresses üïµÔ∏è

Avoid sending cryptocurrency to bad actors and scammers, a list of bad blockchain wallet addresses can be found here in this folder:

- https://github.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/blob/master/src/blacklists/blockchain-wallet-addresses/

## Fraudulent cryptocurrency mining pool addresses ü¶à

Avoid joining bad cryptocurrency mining pools, a list of bad blockchain mining pool addresses can be found here in this folder:

- https://github.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/blob/master/src/blacklists/mining-pools-addresses/

## OFAC sanctioned digital currency addresses üö´

OFAC publishes lists of individuals and companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, targeted countries. It also lists individuals, groups, and entities, such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers designated under programs that are not country-specific. OFAC may add **digital currency addresses** to the SDN List to alert the public of specific **digital currency identifiers** associated with a blocked person.

The OFAC Sanctioned Digital Currency Addresses lists can be found in this folder:

- https://github.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/tree/master/src/ofac-sanctioned-digital-currency-addresses

## Ad server blocking üá¶üá©

The ad banners that you see all over the web are stored on servers. Stopping your computer communicating with another computer can be quite simple. So, if you have a list of the servers used for ad banners, it's easy to stop ad banners even getting to your browser.

These custom ad server filter block lists can be found in the folder:

- https://github.com/Summer-CMS-Vendor-Packages/sc-block-bad-crypto-filter-lists/tree/master/src/blacklists/ad-servers

### How do we define sanctions data?

Sanctioned entities refer to entities listed on economic/trade embargo lists, such as by the US, EU, or UN, with which anyone subject to those jurisdictions is prohibited from dealing. Currently, this includes the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list of the US Department of the Treasury‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

You can search the full list of OFAC Specially Designated Nationals in OFAC's [sanctions database](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/specially-designated-nationals-and-blocked-persons-list-sdn-human-readable-lists).

---

_Mining (Opt-in **and** opt-out) will be blocked by default. If you see that mining is important, you would have to [whitelist](https://adblockplus.org/filters#whitelist) the website you actually want to support._
